The main purpose of this project is to investigate the consumer behavior of Taobao users, from directly analyzing their activities when using Taobao to associating their personal background information with their behavior patterns. 
This analysis provides insights into people’s online shopping behavior patterns and is essential for improving the user experience of these online shopping platforms.


The discussions carried out from the former standpoint include:
* Shopping activity level in relation to time (time-of-day and day-of-week)
* Popularity rank of item categories
* Correlations between behaviors, including clicking a page, favoring an item, adding
an item to the cart and buy an item

Analysis carried out from the latter standpoint includes:
* The role of consumer’s gender/occupation/consumption grade in affecting their
shopping behavior
* How existing Taobao advertisements reflect their understanding of their customers
behavior
